  "protocol": "• Temples: shoulders + knees covered; remove shoes, hats, and sunglasses before entering\n• Wai greeting: slight bow with hands together; not required for tourists but always appreciated\n• Royal family: never joke about monarchy (serious offense under Thai law)\n• Tipping: round up small bills; 20–50 THB extra for great service is enough",
  "utility": "• ATMs: use big-bank machines (Bangkok Bank, SCB, Krungsri); decline DCC to avoid bad FX rates\n• Cash vs card: keep small bills (20/50/100) for street food and taxis; cards fine in malls\n• 7‑Eleven: first stop for SIM top‑ups, snacks, cold drinks, and basic medicine\n• Pharmacies: look for 'Boots' or local pharmacies on main roads; bring photos of medicine labels",
  "dining": "• Menus: point + smile; say 'mai phet' (not spicy) or 'phet nit noi' (a little spicy)\n• Paying: at street stalls, pay after eating; in restaurants, ask 'check bin, krap/ka' for the bill\n• Allergies: show written Thai card for serious allergies; confirm twice before ordering\n• Street food: choose busy stalls with fast turnover; prices posted = less chance of tourist markup",
