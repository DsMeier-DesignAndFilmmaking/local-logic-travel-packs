      "content": "Most Parisian restaurants close by 10pm, but you have options. Look for brasseries (open until midnight or later) in tourist areas like Champs-Élysées or near major train stations. Many kebab shops and pizza places stay open until 2am, especially in areas like Le Marais, Bastille, and around Gare du Nord. For 24-hour options, check out train stations - Gare du Nord and Gare de Lyon have food options. Supermarkets like Carrefour Express are open until midnight in some locations. Avoid tourist trap restaurants on main streets - walk 2-3 blocks away for better prices and quality.",

      "content": "Tourist traps in Paris are concentrated in areas with heavy foot traffic: Champs-Élysées, around the Eiffel Tower, Montmartre near Sacré-Cœur, and the Latin Quarter near Notre-Dame. Key red flags: menus in multiple languages with photos, aggressive touts outside, 'tourist menu' signs, and prices 30-50% higher than nearby streets. The solution: walk 2-3 blocks away from major attractions. In Le Marais, avoid Rue de Rivoli - go to Rue des Rosiers instead. Near the Eiffel Tower, skip the immediate area and walk toward Rue Cler or Invalides. Look for restaurants filled with locals (French conversations, no English menus), lunch 'formule' specials (€12-18 vs dinner €30-50), and places that don't have someone outside trying to get you in.",

Areas to be extra cautious: Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est (especially late at night), certain parts of the 18th and 19th arrondissements, and isolated metro stations after midnight. If you feel unsafe: trust your instincts and leave immediately. Walk toward well-lit, busy areas with people around. Use main streets rather than shortcuts through parks or alleys. If you're lost or need help, look for a police station (marked 'Police' or 'Commissariat'), go into a hotel lobby, or find a busy café or restaurant. Keep emergency numbers handy: 112 (EU emergency), 17 (police), 15 (ambulance). US Embassy: +33 1 43 12 22 22. Stay in well-lit areas, avoid showing expensive items, and keep your phone charged. If using public transport late, sit near the driver or in carriages with other people.",
