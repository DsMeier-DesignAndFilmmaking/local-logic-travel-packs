/**
 * Paris Travel Pack - Pain-Point Driven Data
 * 
 * This file contains the internal, prioritized data model for Paris.
 * Items are organized by universal travel pain points, not activities.
 * 
 * The prioritization function will sort these by priorityScore,
 * ensuring the highest-value pain-relief content appears first.
 * 
 * Future: AI can adjust priorityScore based on:
 * - Time of day (arrival confusion higher in morning)
 * - User behavior (if they keep checking safety, boost safety items)
 * - Season (offline tips more important in winter)
 * 
 * Premium: Can add city-specific context variations or
 * personalized recommendations using the same structure.
