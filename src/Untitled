# Project Context — Local Logic Travel Packs

## Core Product Principle

Voice must always work.
Intelligence should gracefully degrade.
Offline functionality is never blocked by connectivity.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Voice input must function offline using on-device speech recognition.
- Downloaded travel packs are always the source of truth.
- Online AI enhances results but never replaces offline access.
- No feature may hard-fail due to poor or missing internet.
- Offline fallback must feel intentional, not degraded.

## Primary User Story

- User downloads a travel pack and saves it on-device.
- User arrives in destination city.
- User uses voice to find information inside the pack.
- If internet is available, enhanced online intelligence is used.
- If internet is poor or unavailable, the experience seamlessly falls back to offline functionality.

## MVP Guardrails

Explicitly excluded from MVP:
- Full offline LLMs
- Cloud-only speech recognition
- Conversational memory
- Features that block offline usage

## Product Intent

This product is designed for real-world travel conditions:
- Spotty internet
- Limited attention
- One-handed use
- Screen fatigue
